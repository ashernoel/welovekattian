I then learned you were a math god and was like 'holy shit, this girl is way too cool for me.' I still think that you're way too cool for me, but I'm thankful to call you my friend now. There are so many things I admire and respect about you. You literally manage to do everything in the world, succeed in all of them, and still be the cool, chill person that we all know and love. National Econ Challenge, escape room, AP Art History, karaoke, even just random talks on the couches in Shah, etc. — there are so many memories with you that I appreciate (and many more Titanic pictures to prove it). You're the kind of person that people want to have in their lives (which is pretty evident considering how huge this birthday chat for you is HAHA), and I can confidently say that you've managed to impact so many people in such a positive way. I always manage to learn something through my conversations with you. It sucks that we're so far away from each other in college and that I'm absolutely the worst at responding to texts since I miss having you in my life, but I'm happy to see you doing so well. I'm excited for all the things you're doing and what your future holds; let's talk about it sometime over boba or Philz. :) Until then, I hope you have an amazing birthday and the best year!

        question: "Kat/Katty/KattyTDabs/katanada/my shawty bae for life <3 I still remember the day we first met, and it's wild to think that something so funny/silly has turned into a 13+-year friendship, from first grade to senior year and beyond. You've always been one of the most confident, self-assured people that I've known, from playing Gem School and 'Hello, my name is Bye' in 2nd and 3rd grade to making forts in fifth grade to math club in 6th grade to watching you take on the world and blossom as a student and as a person throughout high school and just getting to celebrate all that we've become in senior year.  We haven't had the easiest friendship this whole time, as you might expect from a friendship of 13 years -- for a lot of middle school and early high school, I was dealing with a lot of insecurity and self-doubt, and I couldn't find it within myself to really be happy for other people -- I had to love myself first. But even then, I could tell how much you cared about me and wanted me to be happy -- you were and always have been the first person to cheer me on whenever I accomplished anything, and you'd do the same for anyone in your life. We've been through breakups, ends of friendships, and so many more trials and challenges together, and I couldn't be more thankful to have someone so kind and loyal in my life.  Beyond that, you're one of the most driven and strong people I've met, but you also don't lose sight of your silly side -- you know how to have fun, and I don't think I laugh as hard with anyone else -- nor would I want to. Even so, you know what you're serious about, and you have strong opinions that you're willing to express and defend. You're an incredibly thoughtful person, not only in terms of the things that you do and the people you meet, but also in terms of yourself and what you want out of each and every experience that you've have.  We've come such a long way since we first sat on the benches at recess and read Harry Potter together, or even since we were inseparable in 6th grade math club, and a lot has changed since then, but what I love about our friendship is that we can always pick up where we left off -- seeing you happy and laughing will always make me smile, and seeing you cry will always be more than I can bear.  Happy nineteenth <3 I love you so much and I can't wait for more and more years of getting left on read by you D: -- katexico",

Strictly speaking, it's simply the date that marks one's whole number of trips around the Sun, (almost) uniformly chosen among the 365 each year so that each person has a special day: their own. Socially speaking, society gradually confers legal benefits and removes protections as one progresses through the ranks of age. Practically speaking, it's a fun occasion to celebrate each person, an annual reminder of well-deserved appreciation.  // For you, it means all this (and more!), but... it's also pretty arbitrary, a mere consequence of how civilization has chosen to subdivide time over the years. Not everything has to have intrinsic meaning — you of all people know that best. It can just... be. And that, in and of itself, is meaningful, too. // Enjoy your special day Kat — you deserve only the best :) Happy birthday!",

        question: "We now prove the following proposition.//  Prop 1: kattian is a tree. // Proof: We will prove this isomorphism by showing inclusion in both directions. Note that we are working in the category of living objects: by Descartes, since kat is able to think, therefore she is, so she must be living. First, assume that an object in this category is a tree. We will prove that this object must be kattian by showing that it satisfies all of the KAT AXIOMS. // 1. First, kat’s favorite color is blue. Trees reach towards the sky, which is blue, so their favorite color must also be blue. Furthermore, we can prove that yellow is important to both kat and trees by the following exact sequence: harker c/o 2019 color is yellow -> harker is “K tO LiFe” -> sun gives life to trees -> sun is yellow // 2. kat never responds to my texts. Last time I talked with a tree, it never responded to me, so the response times for both are identically infinite. // 3. kat throws a lot of shade, especially at people like benji. Trees naturally (or should I say, canonically) provide SO much shade, so this axiom is trivially satisfied. // 4. kat has MASSIVE brain and even more MASSIVE muscles #coronapushupchallenge; likewise, trees, especially the ones found in the good old country of California, are Extremely Massive, just like kattian. // Proving the reverse direction – that is, if an object is kat, then it must be a tree – is trivial: since kat is a Stanford wannabe, she must be a tree. Furthermore, she is dating a tree, and since trees can only pollinate each other, kat is either dumb or a tree. As kat has a very massive singular brain cell, she cannot possibly be dumb, so she is a tree. This completes our proof. $\blacksquare$ // In all seriousness, as cheesy as it may sound, you’ve been a tree to me this freshman year. Even during my lows – and trust me, I’ve hit a lot of lows this year – you were always there for me. I think my fondest memories during freshman year were all those late nights with you and Asher, and I can’t begin to say how much those moments have meant to me. Even though, yea, you’re bad at responding to my texts, or yea, you’re always super busy and you don’t have that much free time to spare, your presence alone is more than I could ask for. You’re an incredibly strong, incredibly resilient woman, and you inspire a lot of people around you, especially me. And in that regard, you’ve really helped me find my home at Harvard, a process I’m sure you’re already familiar with via my blog post (lol). In the words of one of my favorite authors, Hermann Hesse: (sorry expos, I know I shouldn’t quote large chunks of text, but this is just really good writing) 'When we are stricken and cannot bear our lives any longer, then a tree has something to say to us: Be still! Be still! Look at me! Life is not easy, life is not difficult. Those are childish thoughts. Let God speak within you, and your thoughts will grow silent. You are anxious because your path leads away from mother and home. But every step and every day lead you back again to the mother. Home is neither here nor there. Home is within you, or home is nowhere at all.'' // So, as you yourself grow a year older and become a little bit bolder, as you add another ring to your trunk, you’re becoming stronger (big bodyyyy) and taller and greater than ever before. There’s a lot ahead of you, and although we may not share any classes next year or have similar long-term interests, I hope I can be there for you every step of the way, just like you’ve been there for me. It is such an honor to have a POPULAR SUPERSTAR like you as one of my closest friends, and I really hope we can keep it that way. Hope your birthday goes well, treat yourself once in a while, get more sleep, and stay the amazing person – the great Sequoia tree – that you are. :)",
